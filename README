This package is written in ANSI C and was tested only under
SuSE Linux 7.2, but should compile with little or no change under any
other UNIX-like OS.

The cutils collection is composed by:
  cdecl and cundecl - decode and encode C type declarations
  cobfusc - make a C source file unreadable but compilable
  chilight - highlight C source files
  cunloop - unloop C loops
  yyextract - extract grammar rules from yacc grammar
  yyref - generate cross-reference for yacc input
